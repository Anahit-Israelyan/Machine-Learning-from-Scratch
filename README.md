# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of foundational Machine Learning algorithms built entirely from scratch. 

The goal of this project is to deepen my mathematical and algorithmic understanding of these models by implementing their core mechanics without relying on high-level frameworks like Scikit-learn. 

## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms

Currently, this repository includes scratch implementations of:
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implementation of distance metrics and neighbor voting mechanisms.
* **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** Implementation involving expectation-maximization (EM) steps for clustering.
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** Implementation of node splitting, entropy/Gini impurity calculations, and tree traversal.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **NumPy** (for linear algebra and matrix operations)
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)

## 🚀 Future Additions
I am actively updating this repository with more algorithms as I continue to translate theoretical mathematics into functional code.
